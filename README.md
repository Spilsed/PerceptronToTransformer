# Perceptron To Transformer

Go from creating a single perceptron all the way to modern transformers, all from scratch with numpy.

## Current Status (Ongoing)

This is still an ongoing project. After all of the models are implemented actual documentation and tutorials will be created.

- [x] Perceptron
- [x] Multi-Layer Perceptron
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- [ ] Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- [ ] Transformer
